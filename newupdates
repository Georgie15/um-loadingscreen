⚒️  General Updates ⚒️
Automatic Plate Checker
LEO can now automatically check if a player's vehicle is in the CAD, any active BOLOs, as well as the player's name, vehicle history, etc. If the vehicle is in the CAD, additional information will display. If it's not, it will tell you they are not registered. Simply use the "plate lock" keybind to activate this process.

Functional Scuba Gear
The scuba mask (#42 in glasses) will now let you go under water without having to worry about air. You can also activate a scuba flash light by doing /togglescuba to let you see under water. Whitelisted LEO can now use this for marine as well.

Spike Strips Improvements
LEO spikes now deploy instantly instead of the previous animation, they will also remove instantly instead of individually.

Persistent Flashlights
Now in-game, your flashlight will stay on even if your weapon is down.

Taser Update
Now in-game, your weapon will drop out of your hand when tased by Whitelisted LEO. Once the weapon is on the ground, it can be "cleared" when near it.

LEO Health Increase
Whitelisted LEO will now receive full GTA armor when they revive or respawn, giving them nearly double health.

New ID Card Features
You can now view your own id or show players near you using the /showid command.

Revamped Hospitalization
Whitelisted LEO will now hospitalize dead bodies at LEO scenes. All hospitalizations are 10 minutes and take you to the prison's infirmary room.
(This change was made to reduce deaths in LEO scenes and force people to value their lives now that dying is more time than going to prison)

EasyAdmin Improvements
Staff jails, warnings, kicks, and bans are now stored in the server database to enable staff to view your punishment history in-game.
Staff can now view a player's punishment history in easyadmin to view punishments over the last 7d. (Starting from today)
The UI for the /staffjail should have an input now, that has the option to do 1-20 community tasks. (Check SOP for new rules)
Management Team now has the ability to unstaffjail players.
Players cannot type/open chat or spawn vehicles through F9 while in staff jail.
Players cannot shoot or spawn vehicles through F9 while frozen.

LEO Jailing Improvements
Added 5 min cooldown for normal jailing.
Management Team can unjail players from prison.
Max jail time is now 360 months instead of 3600.
